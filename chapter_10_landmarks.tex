As stated above, landmarks can be set on surfaces by pressing ``L" + left mouse click. Several actions
can be performed on landmarks.


\section{Select landmark range}
\noindent
\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
By opening the ``select landmark range" window, you can
select a given range of landmarks. This option may be useful
when you need to save only a specific sub-range of all digitized landmarks.

\noindent


\section{Selected landmarks: decrease landmark number (move up in list)}
This option will increase (=move up in list, if possible) the landmark number of all selected landmarks. This option can be also activated by clicking on \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{images/06/objects/move_up.png} in the "object controls" section of the main window.
 
\section{Selected landmarks: increase landmark number (move down in list)}
 This option will decrease (=move down in list, if possible) the landmark number of all selected landmarks.
This option can be also activated by clicking on \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{images/06/objects/move_down.png} in the "object controls" section of the main window.

\section{Selected landmarks: push back on object surface}
When set via pressing ``L" + left click, landmarks are always positioned at a surface's vertex coordinates. Selected
landmarks can be subsequently moved manually to other locations (for instance, if you want to place
a given landmark in the middle of a canal or of a foramen, or between two unfused bones). However,
you may sometimes want to push back automatically some selected landmarks to the position of the
closest surface's vertex available. This can be achieved using this option.

\section{Selected landmarks: change orientation according to surface's normals}
When set via pressing ``L" + left surfaces, landmark orientation is that of the vertex on which it is
placed. Selected landmarks' orientation can be subsequently moved manually. However, you may
sometimes want to reset one or several landmarks' orientation automatically to that of the normal of the closest
surface's vertex available. This can be achieved using this option.

\section{Selected curve nodes and curve handle landmarks}\label{landmarks_curves_section}

\subsection{Move curve handles semi-automatically}
\noindent
\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
This option allows saving a lot of time when creating
3D Bezier curves with MorphoDig (see Fig. \ref{move_handles}). Also see ``working
with curves" tutorial for further details regarding curve digitization with MorphoDig).
\end{minipage}    
\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}\centering

 \end{minipage} 
\noindent



Requirement : at least a handle landmark (``purple" landmark) must be selected.
Depending on whether selected curve handles lie within the curve, at the start of the curve or at the
end of the curve, their displacements differ (see Fig. \ref{move_handles2})

Vector $\overrightarrow{AB}$ is computed, as well as its length |AB|. Right: curve handle associated to A is moved from point A along $\overrightarrow{AB}$. Displacement length=movement intensity/|AB|.\newline 2. Left: curve handle is associated to a point B lying between two points (A and C). Vector $\overrightarrow{AC}$ is computed, as well as its length |AC|. Right: curve handle associated to B is moved from point B along $\overrightarrow{AC}$. Right: displacement length=movement intensity/|AC|.  \newline 3. Left: curve handle is associated to a curve ending point (C), and a preceding point (B) exists. Vector $\overrightarrow{BC}$ is computed, as well as its length |BC|. Right: curve handle associated to C is moved from point C along $\overrightarrow{BC}$. Displacement length=movement intensity/|BC|. }

\subsection{Normal nodes (red): change as starting modes (dark green)}
Selected landmark will be given flag ``1"


\subsection{Normal nodes (red): connect to preceding starting nodes (cyan)}
Selected landmark will be given flag ``3".


\subsection{Normal nodes (red): define as milestone (blue)}
Selected landmark will be given flag ``2".

\subsection{Reset selected nodes to Normal nodes (red)}
Selected landmark will be given flag ``0".

\noindent Further information regarding curve use in MorphoDig is available in the section ``File $\rightarrow$
Curves" section (section \ref{file_curve_section} p.\pageref{file_curve_section}) and in the tutorial ``working with curves".

\section{Edit color of all selected flag landmarks}
\section{Edit length of all selected flag landmarks}
\noindent
\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
Using this option, you can modify the length and the color
of several selected flag landmarks at once.
