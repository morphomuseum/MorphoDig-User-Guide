1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Open surface file. 3 possibilities. 1) Click on open data
2) File=>Surface => open surface  3) drag and drop surface file inside 3D window

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,300
The 3D surface appears in grey : it is selected and can be rotated / translated

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,100
Click on the "yellow arrow" button to activate "Move selected objects" mode

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,100
Left click + drag mouse to rotate the surface

5
00:00:23,397 --> 00:00:26,397
Middle click + drag mouse to translate the surface

6
00:00:29,305 --> 00:00:32,172
By default, 1 square = 1cm * 1cm.

7
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:35,965
Grid size can be changed. Here 1 square will be 1mm*1mm

8
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:39,808
Mouse roll to zoom-in or zoom out

9
00:00:41,986 --> 00:00:46,019
3D surfaces can be rotated / translated using the yellow sliders on the side of the screen

10
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:59,322
The surface is now positionned in a "biologically relevant" orientation

11
00:00:59,779 --> 00:01:06,679
Use the 6 camera predefined orientations to view your model from all sides (which is useful when digitizing landmarks)

12
00:01:11,744 --> 00:01:16,344
Activate "camera mode" to rotate the camera (left click + drag mouse)

13
00:01:16,364 --> 00:01:18,364
Hide/display grid

14
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:25,213
Right click + drag mouse draws a rectangle ( select/unselect objects ). When drawn "yellow", the surface is unselected.

15
00:01:25,348 --> 00:01:28,281
Open the "edit first selected object window"

16
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:36,430
The position matrix differs from the identity matrix. You can save this position matrix

17
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,220
Surface positions can be saved inside .POS files

18
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:58,810
In order to avoid to select/unselect surfaces with right click + drag mouse, it is advisable to activate "landmark mode" when digitizing landmarks

19
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:02,953
Maintain "L" key pressed + left mouse click to create new landmarks

20
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:10,941
Landmark rendering size can be adjusted

21
00:02:25,652 --> 00:02:31,052
When landmark mode is activated, only landmark objects can be selected/unselected

22
00:02:32,627 --> 00:02:36,627
Most actions can be undone (such as "landmark digitization")

23
00:02:37,197 --> 00:02:42,597
"L" + right click: if a single landmark is selected, its position will be updated

24
00:02:48,077 --> 00:02:53,211
Selected landmarks can be reordered (increased or decreased in landmark list)

25
00:03:03,792 --> 00:03:09,792
To access internal structures, enable ROI (region of interest), and click on "Display ROI"

26
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:16,420
Now use the "control points" (spheres) to adjust the dimensions of the ROI (region of interests)

27
00:03:29,244 --> 00:03:32,244
Regions outside the ROI box become invisible.

28
00:03:33,373 --> 00:03:37,506
Hide ROI box in order to digitize landmarks inside the cranium

29
00:03:38,658 --> 00:03:42,058
Press CTRL+D to unselect all opened objects at once

30
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:52,209
To digitize  landmarsk at the center of foramina, first place them at the border of the structure

31
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:56,716
In a second step, move them one by one.

32
00:03:57,155 --> 00:04:05,155
1) Select landmark (right mouse click & drag)
2) CTRL + mouse middle click & drag (landmark digitization mode activated)

33
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:30,821
To save a project, press CTRL+A (select all opened objects) then click on the "save project" button

34
00:04:44,115 --> 00:04:47,915
Press "Delete" if you want to delete all selected objects

35
00:04:48,135 --> 00:04:50,335
You may reopen the project
