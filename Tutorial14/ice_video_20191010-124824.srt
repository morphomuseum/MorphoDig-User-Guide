1
00:00:00,916 --> 00:00:05,183
Drag and drop the project (.NTW) file inside the main 3D window.

2
00:00:09,331 --> 00:00:14,131
You may hide the grid. Then open the "edit first selected volume" window

3
00:00:14,593 --> 00:00:16,059
Click on "Enable Mask"

4
00:00:19,856 --> 00:00:21,856
Masking tools become available

5
00:00:22,182 --> 00:00:27,316
Let's use the "Pencile sphere" tool, and set pencil radius to 100 (screen) px

6
00:00:28,804 --> 00:00:32,804
"T" + left click => activates pencil tag tool.
 "T" + mouse roll =>  increases /decreases pencil radius

7
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:36,635
Here we have used " pencil sphere" + "mask inside"

8
00:00:38,528 --> 00:00:40,195
Click on "invert mask" .

9
00:00:41,914 --> 00:00:46,447
Previously visible regions are now masked, and what was masked is now visible

10
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:52,428
Click on "Pencil tube". Then press "T" + left click.

11
00:00:55,936 --> 00:00:58,936
The newly masked region has a cylindric shape

12
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,633
Let's use the "mask outside" option

13
00:01:06,461 --> 00:01:12,461
"T" + left click (pencil tube + mask outside options) => what remains visible is  tubular.

14
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:18,137
Let's play with the "shift" slider to visualize all unmasked bones.

15
00:01:23,732 --> 00:01:25,532
Masks can be reitinialized.

16
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:43,029
Now use the lasso to mask all bones except the cranium and the mandible.

17
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:03,591
Click on "Export mask" => then export the mask as a metaimage MHD/MHA file

18
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:36,820
Masks MHD/MHA can be read with Fiji. They are 8 bits volume. All masked regions are "black" (0) and all visible regions are "white" (255).

19
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,976
Let's use the "Mask using first selected surface" option.

20
00:02:55,461 --> 00:02:58,661
Let's create an icosahedron with a 15 mm radius.

21
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:21,316
Move this sphere at the desired position (CTRL + middle click drag)

22
00:03:25,562 --> 00:03:31,029
Click on "Mask using first selected surface" button (Mask Inside option activated)

23
00:03:36,028 --> 00:03:38,961
All voxels inside the sphere are now hidden.

24
00:03:44,577 --> 00:03:45,977
Mask reinitialization

25
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:50,787
Now activate the "Mask outside" option.

26
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:56,783
Click again on "Mask using first selected surface" button.

27
00:04:01,718 --> 00:04:05,384
Only voxels situated within the sphere remain visible.

28
00:04:27,396 --> 00:04:28,396
Previously exported masks can be reimported. Click on "import mask".

29
00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:33,862
Choose the previously exported mask

30
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:39,546
Click on "harden mask"

31
00:04:47,742 --> 00:04:55,742
This option will modify the original µCT data and will replace all masked voxels with "0". Note that volume name was postfixed with "_hrd"

32
00:04:57,859 --> 00:04:59,925
Let's saved the modified volume

33
00:05:11,356 --> 00:05:15,222
Open the newly created Metaimage (MHD/MHA) file with Fiji.

34
00:05:38,134 --> 00:05:44,134
Note that all the postcranial bones that had been masked are now removed from theses data.
