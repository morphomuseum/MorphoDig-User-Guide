1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,053
Drag and drop Inner ear surface file inside the main 3D window

2
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:16,510
"Move selected objects mode": Left click drag to rotate the selected surface
Middle click drag to translate the selected surface

3
00:00:24,018 --> 00:00:28,885
Yellow sliders can be used as well to translate / rotate selected objects

4
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:44,116
Create a new tag array

5
00:00:46,105 --> 00:00:47,638
Now open the tag window

6
00:00:52,212 --> 00:00:54,745
Tag region name and color can be edited

7
00:01:05,114 --> 00:01:06,514
Select lasso tag tool

8
00:01:06,998 --> 00:01:09,198
Draw a contour around the cochlea

9
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,060
Let's edit corresponding tag region color

10
00:01:38,654 --> 00:01:41,988
Let's use again the lasso to tag the lateral canal

11
00:01:45,196 --> 00:01:50,329
The wrong active tag region was selected (Cochlea instead of lateral canal)

12
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:55,965
Let's reuse the lasso to tag the lateral canal

13
00:02:00,707 --> 00:02:05,707
Pencil: press "T" + left click

14
00:02:18,902 --> 00:02:23,902
Pencil size can be adjusted interactively by pressing "T" + roll mouse

15
00:02:32,826 --> 00:02:35,659
Let's tag the anterior canal now

16
00:02:46,085 --> 00:02:47,352
Let's use the lasso

17
00:03:01,896 --> 00:03:03,429
Now the posterior canal

18
00:03:07,996 --> 00:03:09,663
Let's use the lasso first

19
00:03:23,934 --> 00:03:24,934
Again the lasso

20
00:03:29,931 --> 00:03:33,464
Some regions of the lateral canal should be completed

21
00:03:34,164 --> 00:03:37,164
Let's use again the pencil ("T" + left click)

22
00:04:13,297 --> 00:04:14,697
Lateral canal ampulla

23
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:20,274
Tag region transparency can be also adjusted as desired

24
00:04:47,008 --> 00:04:48,675
Let's tag the common crus

25
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,300
The wrong tag region is active

26
00:05:07,177 --> 00:05:12,577
Instead of retagging the common crus, we can simply "Undo" last action (CTRL + Z)

27
00:06:02,381 --> 00:06:12,381
Let's use the paint bucket tool with "tag propagation" option activated to tag the vestibulum

28
00:06:18,535 --> 00:06:26,535
"T" + left click was pressed and unfortunately, all other regions were overriden (let's undo that!)
=> Instead, we should press "T" + right click to avoid region override.

29
00:06:34,865 --> 00:06:37,865
Let's use the pencil now to complete the task
