1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,400
Drag and drop the "MHD" (Meta-Image) file inside the main 3D window

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,167
Lighting settings can be adjusted in order to see better the 3D structures

3
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:29,436
Most µCT data are not oriented in a "biologically relevant" manner.

4
00:00:29,792 --> 00:00:37,792
In "Camera mode", selected volumes (drawn with a box outline) can be:
1) rotated (CTRL + left mouse drag)
2) translated (CTRL + middle mouse drag)

5
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:47,358
The yellow sliders can also be useful to translate / rotate selected volumes

6
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:56,330
The tutorial data folder also contains a "POS" (position) file which you can drag and drop inside the 3D main window.

7
00:00:56,802 --> 00:01:04,802
Notice that the volume is now unselected (no bounding box outline drawn)
(to select/unselect volumes:  right mouse drag)

8
00:01:09,693 --> 00:01:18,360
Let's digitize a few landmarks ("L" + left mouse click)

9
00:01:44,128 --> 00:01:50,595
Let's adjust slightly the display range (slider "shift" of the Edit first selected volume window)

10
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:07,091
Now let's digitize landmarks inside the mouse's cranium. To do so, we need to enable ROI, and display ROI

11
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:16,091
Move the spherical controls (left click + drag) to adjust the bounds of the ROI box

12
00:02:26,468 --> 00:02:30,268
Now the "Edit first selected volume" window can be closed

13
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:35,375
Now simply digitize landmarks inside the cranium ("L" + left click).

14
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:43,799
Remember : landmark digitization actions can be undone (CTRL +Z) and redone (CTRL +Y). Also to change the position of a given landmark , select it and press "L" + right click

15
00:02:51,232 --> 00:02:55,166
Now we can save all digitized landmarks inside a text file

16
00:03:15,586 --> 00:03:23,586
The first 3 numbers are the x y z coordinates of each landmark, and the last 3 numbers contain the x y z orientation of the normale.
