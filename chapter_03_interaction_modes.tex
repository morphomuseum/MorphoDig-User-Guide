 \section{Object selection }

Selected objects (3D surfaces and landmarks) are drawn ``grey". Unselected ``normal" landmarks are red, while ``target" landmarks are yellow. Unselected surfaces can be drawn:
\begin{itemize}
\item Using a uniform ``solid" color (scalar display mode must be deactivated or active scalar set to ``none")
\item According to tag values at each vertex (scalar display mode must be active \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{images/pixmap/Show_Tag_Window.png})
\item	According to scalar values at each vertex (scalar display mode active \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{images/pixmap/show_color_scale.png} )
\end{itemize}





\section{Interaction modes}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Camera mode}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{images/pixmap/move.png}``Camera mode" is the default interaction mode, and is active on startup. When active, left and middle mouse button drags result in camera rotation/translation, respectively.
\subsection{Object mode}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{images/pixmap/move_mode2.png}When active, left and middle mouse button drags result in object rotation/translation, respectively.
\subsection{Landmark mode}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{images/pixmap/Landmarks2.png}When active, only landmarks can be selected/unselected via right mouse button drag/click. This mode is useful when editing/placing landmarks. Left and middle mouse button drags result in camera rotation/translation, respectively.

\section{Landmark setting modes}
Landmarks can be set on surfaces by pressing ``L" + left mouse click. 
Two series of conventional landmarks can be set with MorphoDig: ``normal" and ``target" landmarks. Additionally a third landmark series (``flag" landmarks) can be used to label surface structures. 
\subsection{Normal landmark mode}	
Press ``\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{images/pixmap/Landmarks4.png}" to activate this mode (this mode is active by default)
\subsection{Target landmark mode}	

Press ``\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{images/pixmap/Landmarks6.png}"  to activate this mode
\subsection{Flag landmark mode}	

Press ``\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{images/pixmap/Flag01.png}" to activate this mode
