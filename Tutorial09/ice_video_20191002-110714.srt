1
00:00:02,685 --> 00:00:06,751
Drag and drop the surface file (Enamel Dentine Junction file)

2
00:00:10,778 --> 00:00:12,111
Let's hide the grid!

3
00:00:15,894 --> 00:00:20,427
Compute mean surface curvature scalar.

4
00:00:23,766 --> 00:00:25,033
Open scalars window

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,920
Accept suggested max and min values.

6
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,144
Select the surface and smooth the currently active scalar (Curvature_mean)

7
00:00:48,677 --> 00:00:54,944
Choose the second option (smoothing based on vertices found within a sphere of a given radius)

8
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:07,163
Now accept suggested display min and max values.

9
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:20,602
Smooth_curvature_mean scalars can be normalized (if needed)
