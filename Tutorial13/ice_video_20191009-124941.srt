1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000


2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,106
Drag and drop project file (.NTW) inside main 3D window

3
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:14,218
When opening a NTW file, 3D volumes and 3D surfaces will be unselected by default.

4
00:00:14,895 --> 00:00:20,362
To interact with the opened volume, it must be selected first (right click + drag). Selected volumes are drawn with a bounding box.

5
00:00:20,756 --> 00:00:30,689
Use the yellow sliders to rotate/translate selected volumes

6
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:42,264
Activate "move selected objects" interaction mode

7
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:49,399
Now use "left click + drag" to rotate the volume, and "middle click + drag" to translate the volume

8
00:00:52,269 --> 00:00:53,936
Active "move camera mode"

9
00:00:55,431 --> 00:00:58,364
Open the "edit first selected volume" window

10
00:01:00,796 --> 00:01:03,129
Click on "display Crop box" button.

11
00:01:03,971 --> 00:01:11,971
Adjust the bounds of the crop box (left click + drag the spherical controls)

12
00:01:25,793 --> 00:01:33,793
Now click on "crop". As the volume was rotated, a warning message shows up, indicating that the volume data will be resliced before being cropped

13
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:45,759
Thats it ! Notice that a post fix ( "_rsp_crp") is added to the name of the volume, to remind us that it was resliced and cropped.

14
00:01:48,814 --> 00:01:51,814
Now browse through the re-oriented 2D slices.

15
00:01:55,571 --> 00:02:00,305
Modified volume data can be saved inside a new MetaImage (MHD/MHA) file

16
00:02:15,828 --> 00:02:23,161
The metaimage (MHD/MHA) format is convenient: it can be used in a wide range of other software, including FIJI

17
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:53,434
Here we compare with FIJI the initial metaimage volume, and the resliced + cropped final volume data.
