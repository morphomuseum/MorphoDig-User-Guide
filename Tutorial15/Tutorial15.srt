00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,530
The article "Apparatus architecture of the conodont Nicoraella kockeli (Gondolelloidea, Prioniodinina) constrains functional interpretations" contains supplementary data

00:00:09,402 --> 00:00:12,402
Click on https://doi.org/10.5523/bris.p515kyhwv3ec29zo7an2psqju

4
00:00:12,654 --> 00:00:14,987
This opens the 3D model supplementary data webpage

5
00:00:15,402 --> 00:00:17,469
You can download the .PLY file an unzip it

6
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:27,485
It takes a little bit longer than expected... sorry for the delay

7
00:00:29,403 --> 00:00:30,870
A few seconds left...

8
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:37,002
Now open the .PLY file with MorphoDig

9
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:48,818
You can activate the "RGB" array to display the colors.

10
00:00:49,153 --> 00:00:52,753
Many 3D software, and most 3D printer software expect surface models to be expressed in millimeters ("mm").

11
00:00:53,403 --> 00:01:01,403
Default grid size in MorphoDig is set up so that 1 square is 1cm * 1cm long. Meanwhile this conodont 3D model is expected to be less than 1mm long in its largest dimension.

12
00:01:02,153 --> 00:01:08,153
We can deduce that this model is probably expressed in "nanometers" (because the original specimen was scanned at a nanometric resolution). We can select this model and reduce its size by a factor of 1000 to express it in "mm".

13
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:16,652
Do do so, replace the first three "1" of the diagonal of the position matrix by 0.001

14
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:22,001
Click on apply to all selected surfaces

15
00:01:30,152 --> 00:01:35,752
We see here that the model is now now much smaller, around  1 mm long, which is what we expect it to be.

16
00:01:44,153 --> 00:01:48,886
We may rename this object to remind us that we reexpressed it using mm units.

17
00:01:50,403 --> 00:01:55,270
Now let's click on "harden transform" to apply this matrix to the model.

18
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:19,818
We can re-orient the 3D model so that it gets a more convenient orientation during the 3D printing process.

19
00:02:20,652 --> 00:02:24,985
You can use the yellow sliders to change the 3D model orientation

20
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,253
Here "CTRL" + middle click is used to translate the model.

21
00:02:30,653 --> 00:02:33,186
Rotation yellow slider...

22
00:02:34,902 --> 00:02:38,002
Then again "CTRL" + middle click (translation) and then "CTRL" +  left click (rotation)

23
00:02:39,653 --> 00:02:41,520
Rotation yellow slider again

24
00:02:44,651 --> 00:02:46,984
"CTRL" + middle click (translation)

25
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:52,385
Now let's harden transform once again the position matrix.

26
00:03:00,902 --> 00:03:06,102
We can change the name of the model to remind us that its position was changed

27
00:03:10,403 --> 00:03:18,403
We do not want (nor can) print a 1mm long object. We have to increase the size of the 3D model. Let's choose a rescaling factor.

28
00:03:19,153 --> 00:03:26,086
A multiplication factor of 200 seems quit good to produce a fairly big enough 3D model of this conodont.

29
00:03:33,402 --> 00:03:36,402
Again, let's harden this transformation matrix.

30
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:46,567
1 square of the grid is 1cm*1cm, so now, this 3D model is around 11 cm tall and slightly less than 20 cm long, which will nicely fit on a Prusa i3 MK3 printer bed.

31
00:03:52,652 --> 00:04:00,652
Again, we can modify the name of the 3D model to remind us that we will print a 3D model that has been increased 200 times (so not a "real size" conodont!).

32
00:04:02,403 --> 00:04:07,803
Let's save the project (in order not to lose all the repositioning and rescaling)

33
00:04:11,152 --> 00:04:12,885
We can create a new folder

34
00:04:21,402 --> 00:04:29,402
If we printed this 3D model directly, the different conodont ellements would fall apart, because they lack connectivity. And we would lose the orientation and position of all these elements.

35
00:04:31,152 --> 00:04:39,152
In order keep all the conodont elements in their current orientations and positions, we need to produce so-called "connective struts". This can be achieved in MorphoDig inside the menue "Create 3D primitives".

36
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:50,151
Here for instance, we create a 13 cm long * 6 cm large * 6mm tall  rectangular shape that will be the "base" of our 3D print

37
00:04:53,402 --> 00:05:01,402
Let's reposition this rectangular parallelepiped object

38
00:05:01,653 --> 00:05:04,186
"CTRL" + middle click to translate it

39
00:05:12,402 --> 00:05:14,335
Let's view it from front side

40
00:05:14,903 --> 00:05:16,703
"CTRL" + middle click again

41
00:05:21,402 --> 00:05:26,402
Now let us "glue together" a few conodont elements.

42
00:05:26,653 --> 00:05:35,020
Let's start to create a few cylinders (10 for instance). For this model to be correctly 3D printed, we will need between 30 and 40 connective struts.

43
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:52,151
The most time consuming task is now to give a good position and orientation in space to each cylinder in order to "stick together" all conodont element.

44
00:05:52,904 --> 00:05:59,571
"CTRL" + middle click to translate this cylinder. "CTRL" + left click to change its orientation....

45
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:14,273
2 elements are  becoming connected in 3D space.

46
00:06:20,152 --> 00:06:22,685
We can now proceed with a second cylinder. Do not forget to save your project from time to time ("CTRL +A" to select all objects, and then "CTRL + S" so save the project).

47
00:06:28,402 --> 00:06:32,869
[...] Less than 1 hour later  : all conodont elements are now connected with around 40 cylinders correctly positionned !

48
00:06:37,902 --> 00:06:40,502
This 3D model is ready for 3D printing! Do not forget to save your project  ("CTRL +A" to select all objects, and then "CTRL + S" so save the project).

49
00:06:40,653 --> 00:06:44,986
Select all 3D objects ("CTRL" + A), and save as a single STL file.

50
00:06:45,903 --> 00:06:46,903
Press "Save"

51
00:06:47,652 --> 00:06:53,785
RGB information will be lost in this STL file. But this is ok to print a single color model.

52
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:09,653
Choose Position => modified. This is very important : the position matrix of each connective strut (cylinders and rectangular shapes) will be hardened transformed inside the 3D single STL file.

53
00:07:12,653 --> 00:07:18,653
Now let's swich to the 3D printer software. In our case, we will print this model with a Prusa i3 MK3S, and use PrusaSlicer software

54
00:07:19,653 --> 00:07:22,520
Import the previously created 3D STL file.

55
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:28,102
The 3D model fits nicely on the 3D printer bed.

56
00:07:29,655 --> 00:07:34,855
The most important parameter in PrusaSlicer is that we need to build support everywhere. We chose a printing layer height of 0.2 mm, which is a good compromise between printing time and printing quality for a 20cm long model.

57
00:07:35,652 --> 00:07:38,519
Let's slice the 3D model

58
00:07:40,152 --> 00:07:47,552
This is how this model will look once 3D printed. All the 3D support material will have to be removed by hand.

59
00:07:52,402 --> 00:07:59,002
Here we can preview how the printed object will look after we will have removed all support material.

60
00:08:00,903 --> 00:08:03,370
Let's export the G-code and print it!

61
00:08:14,154 --> 00:08:16,421
The Prusa i3 MK3S has started a few minutes ago.

62
00:08:20,154 --> 00:08:21,287
Around 20 hours later...

63
00:08:25,903 --> 00:08:32,503
Once the 3D support material has been removed (by hand, mostly using pliers), it looks pretty good! A 3D conodont apparatus printed at a scale of 200.
