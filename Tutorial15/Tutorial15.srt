00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,530
The article "Apparatus architecture of the conodont Nicoraella kockeli (Gondolelloidea, Prioniodinina) constrains functional interpretations" contains supplementary data

3
00:00:09,402 --> 00:00:12,402
Click on https://doi.org/10.5523/bris.p515kyhwv3ec29zo7an2psqju

4
00:00:12,654 --> 00:00:14,987
This opens the 3D model supplementary data webpage

5
00:00:15,402 --> 00:00:17,469
You can download the .PLY file an unzip it

6
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:37,002
Now open the .PLY file with MorphoDig

7
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:48,818
You can activate the "RGB" array to display the colors.

8
00:00:49,153 --> 00:00:52,753
Many 3D software, and most 3D printer software expect surface models to be expressed in millimeters ("mm").

9
00:00:53,403 --> 00:01:01,403
Default grid size in MorphoDig is set up so that 1 square is 1cm * 1cm long. Meanwhile this conodont 3D model is expected to be less than 1mm in its largest dimension.

10
00:01:02,153 --> 00:01:07,153
We can deduce that this model is probably expressed in "nanometers" (because the original specimen was scanned at a nanometric resolution). We can select this model and reduce its size by a factor of 1000 to express it in "mm".

11
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:16,652
Do do so, replace the first three "1" of the diagonal of the position matrix by 0.001

12
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:22,001
Click on apply to all selected surfaces

13
00:01:30,152 --> 00:01:35,752
We see here that the model is now much smaller, around  1 mm long, which is what we expect it to be.

14
00:01:44,153 --> 00:01:48,886
We may rename this object to remind us that we rescaled it to mm units.

15
00:01:50,403 --> 00:01:55,270
Now let's click on "harden transform" to apply this matrix to the model.

16
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:19,818
We can re-orient the 3D model to give it a more convenient orientation for the 3D printint process.

17
00:02:20,652 --> 00:02:24,985
You can use the yellow sliders to change the 3D model orientation

18
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,253
Here "CTLR" + middle click is used to trnaslate the model.

19
00:02:30,653 --> 00:02:33,186
Then again one ot the rotation sliders

20
00:02:34,902 --> 00:02:38,002
Then again "CTRL" + middle click (translation) and then "CTRL" +  left click (rotation)

21
00:02:39,653 --> 00:02:41,520
Rotation yellow slider again

22
00:02:44,651 --> 00:02:46,984
"CTRL" + middle click (translation)

23
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:52,385
Now let's harden the position matrix.

24
00:03:00,902 --> 00:03:06,102
We can change the name of the model to remind us that its position was changed

25
00:03:10,403 --> 00:03:18,403
But we do not want (nor can) print a 1mm long object. We have to increase the size of the 3D model, and we now can choose a rescaling factor.

26
00:03:19,153 --> 00:03:26,086
A multiplication factor of 200 seems quit good to produce a fairly big enough 3D model of this conodont.

27
00:03:33,402 --> 00:03:36,402
Again, let's harden this transform

28
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:46,567
1 square of the grid is 1cm*1cm, so now, this 3D model is around 11 cm tall and slightly less than 20 cm long.

29
00:03:52,652 --> 00:04:00,652
Again, we can modify the name of the 3D model to remind us that we will print a 3D model that has been increased 200 times (so not a "real size" conodont!).

30
00:04:02,403 --> 00:04:07,803
Let's save the project (in order not to lose all the repositioning and rescaling)

31
00:04:11,152 --> 00:04:12,885
we can create a new folder

32
00:04:21,402 --> 00:04:29,402
If we print this 3D model directly, the different conodont ellements will fall apart, because they lack connectivity. And we will lose the orientation and position of all these elements.

33
00:04:31,152 --> 00:04:39,152
In order keep all the conodont elements in their current orientations and positions, we need to produce so-called "connective struts". This can be achieved in MorphoDig inside the menue "Create 3D primitives".

34
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:50,151
Here for instance, we create a 13 cm long * 6 cm large * 6mm tall  rectangular shape that will be the "base" of our 3D print

35
00:04:53,402 --> 00:05:01,402
Let's reposition this rectangular parallelepiped object

36
00:05:01,653 --> 00:05:04,186
"CTRL" + middle click to translate it

37
00:05:12,402 --> 00:05:14,335
Let's view it from front side

38
00:05:14,903 --> 00:05:16,703
"CTRL" + middle click again

39
00:05:21,402 --> 00:05:26,402
Now let us "glue together" a few conodont elements.

40
00:05:26,653 --> 00:05:31,020
Let's create a few cylinders (10 for instance)

41
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:52,151
The most time consuming task is now to give a good position and orientation in space to each cylinder in order to "stick together" all conodont element.

42
00:05:52,904 --> 00:05:59,571
"CTRL" + middle click to translate this cylinder. "CTRL" + left click to change its orientation....

43
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:14,273
2 elements are  becoming connected in 3D space.

44
00:06:20,152 --> 00:06:22,685
Now let's start with a second cylinder

45
00:06:28,402 --> 00:06:32,869
A long (long) time later : all conodont elements are now connected!

46
00:06:37,902 --> 00:06:40,502
This 3D model is ready for 3D printing!

47
00:06:40,653 --> 00:06:44,986
Select all 3D objects ("CTRL" + A), and save as a single STL file

48
00:06:45,903 --> 00:06:46,903
Press "Save"

49
00:06:47,652 --> 00:06:53,785
RGB information will be lost in this STL file. But this is ok to print a single color model.

50
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:09,653
Choose Position => modified. This is very important : the position matrix of each connective strut (cylinders and rectangular shapes) will be hardened transformed inside the 3D single STL file.

51
00:07:12,653 --> 00:07:18,653
Now let's swich to the 3D printer software. In our case, we will print this model with a Prusa I3 MK3S, and use PrusaSlicer software

52
00:07:19,653 --> 00:07:22,520
Import the previously created 3D STL file.

53
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:28,102
The 3D model fits nicely on the 3D printer bed.

54
00:07:29,655 --> 00:07:34,855
The most important parameter here is that we need to build support everywhere.

55
00:07:35,652 --> 00:07:38,519
Let's slice the 3D model

56
00:07:40,152 --> 00:07:47,552
Here is how this model will look once 3D printer. All the 3D support material will have to be removed by hand.

57
00:07:52,402 --> 00:07:59,002
Here we can monitor of the printed object will look once we will have removed all support material.

58
00:08:00,903 --> 00:08:03,370
Let's export the G-code and print it!

59
00:08:14,154 --> 00:08:16,421
The Prusa i3 MK3S has just started.

60
00:08:20,154 --> 00:08:21,287
A few hours later

61
00:08:25,903 --> 00:08:32,503
Once the 3D support material has been removed (by hand, mostly using pliers), it looks pretty good! A 3D conodont apparatus printed at a scale of 200.
