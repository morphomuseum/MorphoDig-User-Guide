1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Drag and drop all TIFF files inside the main 3D window

2
00:00:10,503 --> 00:00:18,503
Fill voxel size (here: 36µm = 0.036mm). And choose between "front to back" or "back to front" image order. 
Here, image order is "back to front".

3
00:00:26,983 --> 00:00:29,050
You may choose to hide the grid

4
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:37,852
Open the "edit first selected volume" window
(selected volumes have a bounding box outline)

5
00:00:40,543 --> 00:00:47,476
You may decide to hide the volume rendering representation
and to display instead XY, XZ, or YZ slices.

6
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,716
Lighting options can be adjusted in order to enhance the visibility of structures.

7
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:15,699
Display range can be shifted in order to visualize dense inner structures such as the bones

8
00:01:27,313 --> 00:01:31,580
Volume data can be exported in the MetaImage format (MHD or MHA)

9
00:01:33,112 --> 00:01:39,512
When saved as MHD, two files will be created: a .mhd (header) file, and a .raw/.zraw (data) file

10
00:01:39,984 --> 00:01:41,450
Data can be compressed

11
00:01:55,814 --> 00:02:04,714
Header (.mhd) file contain relevant information such as data type, data dimension and voxel size

12
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:17,715
Metaimage files (MHD/MHA) can be read and written with Fiji, and with many other software.
