1
00:00:02,451 --> 00:00:06,584
Drag and drop inner ear surface file inside the main 3D window

2
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:12,100
Activate "move selected objects" mode

3
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:19,378
In this mode, objects can be translated (middle click + drag) or rotated (left click + drag).

4
00:00:22,128 --> 00:00:29,062
Positionning inner ears in a "biologically relevant" orientation will make it easier to digitize curves.

5
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:39,698
Tutorial data contain a position file ".POS" which you can directly drag and drop in the main 3D window to position the selected inner ear surface

6
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:48,676
You may decide to hide the grid

7
00:00:50,806 --> 00:00:56,339
Curve digitization inside inner ear canals is much easier on "transparent" surfaces

8
00:00:57,562 --> 00:01:01,662
VERY IMPORTANT: activate "Digitize curve node landmarks" button

9
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:23,523
Press "L" + left click to digitize new curve node landmarks

10
00:01:30,377 --> 00:01:51,110
Let's draw rough outlines along the three semi-circular canals as well.

11
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:12,360
You may change the background color to increase the visibility of the inner structures and of the curve node outlines

12
00:02:23,748 --> 00:02:34,948
Let's finish to digitize a rough outline for the posterior semi-circular canal

13
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:43,822
As  we will have to move A LOT the position of curve nodes and curve handles, so it's better to activate "Landmark Digitization mode",
which will prevent to select/unselect the 3D surface while doing these adjustments

14
00:02:44,400 --> 00:03:04,400
Here, we select the 3 node landmarks placed at the beginning of the lateral, anterior and posterior canals, 
(11, 17 and 23) and define them as "Curve starting nodes"

15
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:11,659
Now the rough cochlear outline and those of the 3 semi-circular canals are separated in space

16
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:26,487
Now let's position each curve node landmark inside the cochlea/canals

17
00:03:27,113 --> 00:03:33,313
To do that select 1 single node landmark, and (in landmark digitization mode) press CTRL + middle click drag

18
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:38,845
Select 2nd curve node, then press CTRL + middle click drag to move it

19
00:03:41,841 --> 00:03:46,441
Select 3rd curve node, then press CTRL + middle click drag to move it

20
00:03:47,023 --> 00:04:17,023
Select next curve node, then press CTRL + middle click drag to move it etc.

21
00:04:21,454 --> 00:04:59,454
Proceed (select next curve node, then press CTRL + middle click drag to move it)
until all curve node landmarks are located at the center of the cochlea / semi-circular canals

22
00:07:28,614 --> 00:08:09,514
Oncel all curve node landmarks are located at the center of the cochlea / semi-circular canals, save 
them inside a .VER file (File => Curves => Save curve node landmarks)

23
00:08:31,436 --> 00:08:37,569
Now go in File=>Curves=>Load Curve Handle landmarks and choose the file you just have saved.

24
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:47,812
A expected, a series of curve handle landmarks have been created, and each curve handle has
the same position as its node counterpart

25
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:56,561
Now select all handle landmarsk (it does not matter if node landmarks are selected as well) and open the 
"Move curve handles semi-automatically" menu

26
00:09:04,151 --> 00:09:09,551
All curve handles have been moved , but have not yet reached an optimal position.

27
00:09:14,996 --> 00:11:02,996
The last (and most time consuming) step is to adjust manually the position of each curve node and each curve handle to 
follow the center of each semi-circular canal and of the cochlea (Select one single landmark, then press CTRL + middle click drag)
