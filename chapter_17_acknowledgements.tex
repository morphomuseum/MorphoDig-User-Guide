\section {Design concepts}
I wish to thank Christoph Zollikofer and Marcia Ponce de León, from whom I borrowed many of the design concepts implemented in FoRM-IT (Fossil Reconstruction and Morphometry Interactive Toolkit; \citep{Zollikofer1995,Zollikofer2005}).

\section {Code development}
 I wish to thank Stefan Schlager and Léo Botton-Divet for their helpful comments and their contribution to the cross-platform compatibility of the source code.  

\section{Specimens illustrated} 
I wish to thank the curators of different institutions for the access to most specimens illustrated
in this document: Nathalie Mémoire from the Musée d'Histoire Naturelle de Bordeaux, Christoph
Zollikofer and Marcia Ponce de León from the Anthropological Institute and Museum of Zürich, Suzane Jiquel from the ISEM. Thanks also to Mona Le Luyer and Pauline Colombet (PACEA, Bordeaux),
the PEPS IdEx Bordeaux / CNRS 3 Dent'in for the access to the digital reconstruction of the specimen
SP07 of Sains-en-Gohelle, and Cédric Beauval and Archéosphère SARL (Bordeaux) for the access to
these remains. Thanks to Lionel Hautier and Mark Wright for the access to the 3D model of nasal turbinates of \textit{Orycteropus afer}

\section{3D data acquisition facilities} 
I wish to thank the MRI Platform (Montpellier), Zollikofer and Marcia Ponce de León from the
Anthropological Institute and Museum (Zürich), Paul Tafforeau and the E.S.R.F. (Grenoble, France) for
the access to the scanning facilities in which the illustrated specimens were digitized.
