1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,467
Drag and drop the RAW file inside the main 3D window

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,870
The Open RAW Volume windows shows up

3
00:00:07,328 --> 00:00:15,328
Fill  data type (8 bits, 16bits, 32 bits...), data dimensions (number of voxels in x, y and z dimensions),
 header size (if greater than 0)

4
00:00:16,047 --> 00:00:18,914
Requested size should be equal to file size

5
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:26,651
Fill data endianess (when Data Type is 16bits or 32 bits). For 8 bits dataset, endianess does not matter.

6
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:33,661
µCT Images  are most often "Back to Front" ordered, but here we have a "Front to back" RAW volume.
Then fill voxel size : in this example,  36µm = 0.036mm

7
00:00:41,536 --> 00:00:47,269
This RAW volume contains more than 500*500*500 voxels, and a warning message shows up.

8
00:00:48,392 --> 00:00:56,392
Large dataset are difficult to render on the graphics card (the computer may crash). 
By default, MorphoDig will render a subsampled version of  a given dataset when the number 
of voxels exceeds 500*500*500 voxels.

9
00:01:05,558 --> 00:01:10,891
Open the "Edit first selected volume window" 
(selected volumes have a bounding box outline... WARNING: only selected volumes can be interacted with)

10
00:01:11,527 --> 00:01:17,660
Here we can test whether our graphics card can render the full dataset (594*294*1038 voxels)

11
00:01:19,673 --> 00:01:22,006
Apparently it can without trouble.

12
00:01:28,098 --> 00:01:34,298
Then we can increase manually this "out of core" threshold value (Edit=> Edit volume options)

13
00:01:35,115 --> 00:01:43,115
Let's set this value to 200 million voxels. Next time we will open this RAW volume, the warning message will not show up.

14
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:47,274
Now let's change the display values

15
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:51,890
The shift slider moves the display min and max values together.

16
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:58,979
You may also adjust the max value alone with the max slider.

17
00:01:59,516 --> 00:02:02,849
Same thing for the min value

18
00:02:04,087 --> 00:02:07,420
Transparency levels can be adjusted interactively.

19
00:02:15,987 --> 00:02:20,320
The colormap can be also changed using the "colormaps" combo box.
