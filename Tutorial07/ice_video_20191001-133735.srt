1
00:00:02,632 --> 00:00:05,832
Open the "Primate_femur_thickness" project (NTW)

2
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:20,621
2 surface bones are opened. A right femur of Erythrocebus pattas (smaller) and a right femur of Papio sp. (larger)

3
00:00:22,937 --> 00:00:27,204
Select the right femur of Erythrocebus patas (right click+ drag)

4
00:00:27,636 --> 00:00:32,636
Scalars=> compute thickness within each selected surface. For this femur, we do not expect cortical thickness to exceed 3mm.
(set this value as low as possible to decrease computation time)

5
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,990
Here, I pressed cancel because thickness computation time is quite too long for this video!

6
00:00:40,323 --> 00:00:45,323
For the papio femur, we do not expect cortical thickness to exceed 9 mm (set this value as low as possible to decrease computation time)
Again I pressed cancel because thickness computation time is relatively long

7
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,080
Now activate "Thickness" scalar

8
00:00:53,306 --> 00:00:55,306
Open scalars window

9
00:00:59,094 --> 00:01:03,560
Set display range using "suggested min" and "suggested max" values.

10
00:01:09,818 --> 00:01:12,352
You can shift display range as desired

11
00:01:29,248 --> 00:01:37,248
In order to compare bone thickness distribution patterns in Erythrocebus and Papio, let's normalize bone thickness' scalar

12
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:46,835
Thickness scalar can also be normalized for the right femur of Papio

13
00:01:55,273 --> 00:02:03,273
Now let's activate "Norm_thickness" scalar. Now we can compare bone thickness distribution patterns in those 2 bones of different size.

14
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:14,654
Let's activate the tags array.

15
00:02:18,124 --> 00:02:19,524
Open the "Tag" window

16
00:02:24,726 --> 00:02:26,526
Import the correct tag map!

17
00:02:30,793 --> 00:02:35,059
3 bone regions have been tagged (the 2 epiphyses, and the shaft)

18
00:02:51,856 --> 00:02:59,856
Now you can save information regarding the perviously computed scalar arrays (Thickness , Norm_Thickness etc.)
for each bone region defined in the tags
