abstract = {Abstract There is overwhelming molecular support for the monophyly of a supra‐ordinal clade of living African placental mammals, the Afrotheria, but there is not a single unequivocal morphological synapomorphy for this group. We conducted a survey of thoraco‐lumbar vertebral numbers across mammals, based on the examination of specimens representing 86 living and 12 fossil species and a thorough review of the anatomical literature. A total of 19 thoraco‐lumbar vertebrae is plesiomorphic for mammals, eutherians and metatherians. Metatherians show no variation in this plesiomorphic condition, suggesting the presence of a developmental constraint, in view of the contrasting variability of the equally old eutherian clade. Several deviations from the plesiomorphic condition have evolved independently in the course of placental phylogeny. Optimization of the information on a published phylogenetic framework based on molecular sequence data reveals that an increase in the number of thoracolumbar vertebrae is the ...},

abstract = {A three-dimensional reconstruction of the skeleton of the giant rat of Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain) Canariomys bravoi was obtained by computerized microtomography. Body size, body mass, and body shape were estimated, and limb morphofunctional indices used to infer the style of life of this recently extinct rat. A sample of recent Murinae, including the Philippines endemic giant cloud rat Phloeomys cumingi, was used for comparison. It appears that C. bravoi differed from most continental rats by its relatively large size, body proportions, and tail length. Among its distinctive features, claws almost similarly developed on fore and hind limbs, and feet longer than hands evoke an intermediate body shape between rats and arboreal murines like Phloeomys. C. bravoi was a strong and powerfully muscled rat able to move on different substrates from floor to trees, and probably had digging skills. {\textcopyright} 2012 Acad{\'{e}}mie des sciences.},
