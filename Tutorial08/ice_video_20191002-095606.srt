1
00:00:06,147 --> 00:00:14,147
Drag and drop inside the main 3D window the 2 surfaces: the Outer Enamel Surface (OES) and Enamel Dentine Junction (EDJ)

2
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:29,673
Camera mode: "CTRL + middle click drag" to translate selected surfaces

3
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:34,466
Initial position can be reset by pressing "Undo" (CTRL+Z)

4
00:00:39,222 --> 00:00:40,489
Let's hide the grid

5
00:00:41,335 --> 00:00:44,535
Scalars=> compute thickness between two surfaces

6
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:49,652
It's important here to invert the normals of the observed object (the EDJ).

7
00:00:57,502 --> 00:01:00,568
Thickness computation takes a little while...

8
00:01:01,755 --> 00:01:02,755
Let's wait...

9
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,439
Be patient...

10
00:01:12,675 --> 00:01:16,675
Almost done ?

11
00:01:21,204 --> 00:01:31,204
wait...

12
00:01:33,798 --> 00:01:38,798
Ready?????

13
00:01:43,832 --> 00:01:44,832
Here we are!

14
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,474
Open the edit scalars window.

15
00:01:50,621 --> 00:01:55,288
Use suggested min and suggested max values as display range boundaries

16
00:01:55,775 --> 00:01:58,308
Let's play with the shift range slider

17
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:14,908
Color scale (colors and transparency levels) can be adjusted interactively.
